# Neighborhood Map
This project is a single page application featuring a map of southern Denver-metro area breweries, taphouses, and brewpubs. The map does not merely show locations, users can interact with either map markers or the list provided on the left of the screen. When either is selected, more information about the location is provided via the Foursquare API, including address, phone number(s), social media links, a Google Street View image, and a link for directions. Additionally, users can filter the list based upon what they enter into a search box, as well as show/hide those locations that are taprooms or brewpubs.

## Viewing the Application
To utlize the application, download the source code to your local drive (or clone the repistory) and open index.html in the root of the directory. Or, you could simply access the application online [via GitHub Pages](http://geoffhumphrey.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map).
